    question: "Hi, Kate. What's your story?",
    answer:
      '<strong>Hi, there!  I am a software engineer, but I wasn\'t always.</strong>  I took the scenic route to a coding career.  Along the way, I majored in Science Writing, worked as a journalist and copy-editor for the Chicago Tribune, and managed several (amazing) independent bookstores.  Up until about a year ago, I was busy leveling up as a classroom teacher, developing curriculum and presenting subjects that ranged from formal logic to Norse mythology.<br><br>Then last winter, I earned the opportunity to study computer programming full-time at <a target="_blank" href="https://adadevelopers.org">Ada Developers Academy</a>.  The program was tremendously challenging and endlessly rewarding.  My secret weapon?  All of my prior experiences combined forces to form a real superhero of a core belief: <strong>EVERY problem can be an exciting adventure or a grueling battle; the difference is in the way you tell the story.</strong>'
  },
  {
    question: "Okay, but do you have coding experience?",
    answer:
      "I haven't been far from a command line ... ever. I've been working up my core skills since I couldn't reach the keyboard. My professional experience is in building business-critical applications from the ground up. In just the past few months, I've written and deployed  <strong>API's, AWS Lambda functions, and long-running processes in a cloud architecture</strong>. I've also taken command of <strong>DevOps with Serverless deployment, GitLab CI/CD, and metrics and tracing with Splunk and New Relic.</strong><br><br>I've been working in <code>JavaScript</code>, <code>Ruby</code>, and <code>Java</code> (and teaching in <code>Python</code>). I have proven my ability to ramp up quickly in new languages -- and ramping up in old languages is what I do for fun on the weekends! :)"
  },
  {
    question: "What else have you been up to?",
    answer:
      "I live in Seattle and I enjoy spending time on my bike finding new, interesting views of the city's many planes, trains, barges, and bridges -- and the giant, crazy machines that load, unload, and care for them. <br><br>At home, I like to knit, hang out with friends, and spend time with my pet parrot, Eugene. He never tires of sharing his opinions while looking extremely adorable. (He's on Instagram so I have a great excuse to take cute bird pictures, too.)"
