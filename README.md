# accordion-bio
This is a nifty little site I whipped up to supplement my resume.

It's also a teeny showcase of some things I love to code, but haven't had a chance to do in my most recent position. 

There's a dynamic SVG, the JavaScript is feeding all the content into the accordion from a JSON object, and the container is entirely created in CSS. 

My favorite part (in a "Look, no hands!" kind of way) is this: If you remove all the SVG code and the comments, the HTML is literally only four lines ... and there's nothing in there but semantic tags. Ta-da! ðŸ”®âœ¨
